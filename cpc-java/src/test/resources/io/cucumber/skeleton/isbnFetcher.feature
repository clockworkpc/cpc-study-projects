Feature: ISBN Fetcher
  In order to put together a list of books for sale
  I want to fetch the details of books via their ISBNs from ISBNdb

  Scenario Outline: ISBN Numbers Provided
    Given the box title is "<box>"
    And I make an API call to "ISBNdb" with "<isbn>"
    And the API response code is "200"
    When I parse the API response body and write it to "ISBN CSV"
    Then I should have a copy of the response body in a CSV
    And in the API response the box title should be "<box>"
    And in the API response the long title of the book should be "<long_title>"
    And in the API response the the author of the book should be "<author>"
    And in the API response the the publisher of the book should be "<publisher>"
    And in the API response the the binding of the book should be "<binding>"
    And in the API response the the book should have "<pages>" pages
    And in the API response the the publication date of the book should be "<date_published>"
